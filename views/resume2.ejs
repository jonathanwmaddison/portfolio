                            challenges, and collaborating with a cohort of other freeCodeCamp learners
                            for pair-programming, team projects, and building larger scale collaborative
                            projects.</p>

                            issues. We published several peer-reviewed papers on how the media reports
                            on vehicle emissions (see my publication portfolio). This research formed
                            the basis of my Masters Thesis.</p>
